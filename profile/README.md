# 🍜 Welcome to Elara

**Elara** is a personal project turned into a professional-grade solution — an application designed to simplify and optimize operations in **restaurants, gastrobars, and restobars**. Built with passion by a **Systems Engineering student and software development enthusiast** ([@julianbetov](https://github.com/julianbetov)), Elara combines practical business logic with clean backend architecture.

## 🔨 How are we creating Elara?
- The table above is a production-ready automation tool for keeping a section of a GitHub organization's README synchronized with the live repository's data, using modern Node.js, the GitHub API, and software engineering best practices. [See code here](https://github.com/elara-app/.github/tree/main/src). 
    
    **Key points:**
    - Separation of concerns y modularity.
    - professional GitHub App authentication (Uses GitHub App installation authentication, not a personal token).
    - Dynamic Data Fetching.
    - Markdown Table Rendering.
    - Safe, targeted README updates.
    - Direct GitHub integration.
    - Robust logging & Error handling.

### 🧑‍💻 Development of other services
The Elara's backend is developed with a decoupled **microservices architecture**, each with its own **PostgreSQL database**, asynchronous communication via **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ**, centralized configuration with **Spring Cloud Config Server**, and exposure through an **API Gateway**. It is containerized with **Docker**, orchestrated with **Kubernetes**, and automated with **GitHub Actions** under a **Git Flow**, enabling **professional CI/CD**, **horizontal scalability**, and **cloud deployment** (AWS, Azure, or GCP). It includes **OAuth2 and JWT authentication**, robust validations, centralized error handling, structured logging, and automatic documentation with **Swagger**. And more.

Its design allows it to support **high traffic**, **guarantee security** and **availability**, and facilitate **system maintenance** and **evolution**. It is ideal for medium-sized or large companies that need a solid, scalable, production-ready foundation, or for startups looking for a modern architecture ready to grow without rewriting from scratch.
